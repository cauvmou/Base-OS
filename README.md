# Base-OS
 
This is a plain and simple base to build an OS on.

Just build the docker image and then build the OS with the makefile, to run it I would recommend you use [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).

Simply run the kernel with `qemu-system-x86_64 <path>`

This is far from complete for now so you can only print to the screen.

You could use it as a base for your own, have fun!
